# CPU-in-Verilog

A personal project in a course of my 5th semester, I spent about 3 week to write those code and set up a simple cpu from zero in the end.

I shared the code here, hope that it can help someone in need.

I learned how each module of cpu is structured and how different module messages with each other, althougth physically tired, I am grateful to it when I recall this experience.

code: a simple cpu as a total machine by Verilog, code of all modules in `code` directory screen: screen of all modules in `screen` directory  the code 

The `code` can be
organized as the modules shown below: `alu module`, `control module`, `io module`, `memory
module`, `reg_stack module`, `usb_driver module`, `bcd module`. In the end, I organize those
modules together as a total machine cpu.

Details of the code can be found in the `report.pdf`
